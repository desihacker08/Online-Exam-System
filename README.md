## About the Online Exam System

This Online Exam System Project has 3 types of user roles as I mentioned above. It gives access to the school management, faculties, and students. Each user role contains different permission or restriction to the project features and functionalities. The Student and Faculties are required to register or signup first on the site. The Faculty Accounts requires an admin validation before they can gain access to features and functionalities of its role.

In this system, the Admin Users have the privilege to access and manage most of the features and functionalities. They are the ones who validate the new teachers/faculties system account. They can also update the information of both Students and Faculty details and credentials.

The Faculties/Teachers have the privilege to manage the list of courses and questions. He/She can add a new course, delete a course, add questions to the course, and delete questions.
